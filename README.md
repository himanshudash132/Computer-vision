# Deep Drowsiness Detection App

## Introduction

This project presents a driver drowsiness detection app built using YOLOv8 and PyTorch. The application analyzes driver behavior through video frames and triggers voice alerts if drowsiness is detected, promoting road safety. The user interface (UI) is developed using tkinter.

## Skills

- PyTorch
- YOLOv8
- Deep Learning
- Image Classification
- OpenCV
- UI Development with tkinter

## Usage

1. **Installation**: 
    - Clone the repository:
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/himanshudash132/Computer-vision.git
        ```
    - Navigate to the project directory:
        ```
        cd Computer-vision
        ```
    - Install the required dependencies:
        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

2. **Running the App**:
    - Run the app:
        ```
        python app.py
        ```
    - The UI will open, allowing the user to interact with the application.

3. **Drowsiness Detection**:
    - The app analyzes video frames in real-time.
    - Upon detecting drowsiness, voice alerts are triggered to alert the driver.
